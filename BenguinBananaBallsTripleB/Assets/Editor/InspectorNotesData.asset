  Notes:
  - GameObjectPath: /Player/Inventory/DartPistol
    ComponentType: Weapons.DartPistol
    Note: Reload Time should be higher, maybe 5 (seconds). Just that for testing
      this is easier.
  - GameObjectPath: /Player
    ComponentType: Core.PlayerInventory
    Note: Need to expose more variables here
  - GameObjectPath: /Player
    ComponentType: Core.PlayerLocomotion
    Note: I found these settings worked pretty well, but feel free to mess with them
  - GameObjectPath: /Player
    ComponentType: Input.InputManager
    Note: No touchy, only looky
